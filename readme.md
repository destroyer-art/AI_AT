# AI-Powered Script Generator ðŸš€


This is a work-in-progress application that uses AI to generate engaging video scripts based on your input. It showcases some cool features that demonstrate the capabilities of these technologies.

## Features

The app currently has the following features:

- Researches the topic using Google Search and SerpAPI.
- Generates a script with a custom-trained language model (based on OpenAI's GPT).
- Edits and refines the script using memory integration to make it casual and engaging.
- Finds relevant images for the script using Unsplash API.
- Synthesizes speech audio using AWS Polly.
- Creates a video using the script, images, and audio.

## Work in Progress
* Writing subtitles can take time on longer videos, Just recent I did a fresh install of windows, and upgraded from 10, to windows 11, as well as set my dev environment up this time around using wsl2 with windows, and either the fresh install, or the wsl2 (maybe combination of both) pretty much around 2.5x the speed of rendering/encoding the video, as before.

I'm working on improving the app, and there are some features and refinements that I'm planning to implement in the future. Once I'm happy with the current state of the app and it showcases a few more exciting features, I'll be moving it into a private repository to continue the development.

## How to Use

1. Enter a topic or keyword.
2. The app will generate a script, find relevant images, synthesize speech audio, and create a video.
3. Review the generated script, images, and video.
4. Share your amazing AI-generated YouTube video with the world!

Feel free to explore it and let me know what you think. Your feedback and suggestions will be invaluable as I continue to work on this project.
