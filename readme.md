Features 🚀

The app currently has the following features:

    Researches the topic using Google Search and SerpAPI.
    Generates a script with a custom-trained language model (based on OpenAI's GPT).
    Edits and refines the script using memory integration to make it casual and engaging.
    Finds relevant images for the script using Unsplash API.
    Synthesizes speech audio using AWS Polly.
    Creates a video using the script, images, and audio.

Work in Progress ⚙️

I'm working on improving the app, and there are some features and refinements that I'm planning to implement in the future. Once I'm happy with the current state of the app and it showcases a few more exciting features, I'll be moving it into a private repository to continue the development.
