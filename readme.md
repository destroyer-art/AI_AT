# AI-Driven YouTube Script Creator

This project is an AI-driven web application for generating YouTube video scripts based on user input. The application leverages state-of-the-art language models and multiple APIs to create engaging and informative scripts for various topics. It is currently in development but has already demonstrated promising results.

## Overview

The application takes a user's input (a topic or a keyword) and generates a YouTube video script by performing the following steps:

1. Research the topic using Google Search and SerpAPI.
2. Generate a script using a custom-trained language model (based on OpenAI's GPT).
3. Edit and adjust the script in a fun and relaxed way.
4. Retrieve relevant images for the script using Google Images and SerpAPI.

The application is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. It also employs various libraries, such as `langchain` for interacting with the language model and `serpapi` for working with Google Search and Google Images APIs.

## Features

- AI-driven script generation: The application uses a powerful language model to create engaging and informative scripts for a wide range of topics.
- Research integration: The app integrates Google Search results to provide up-to-date and relevant information for the generated script.
- Image retrieval: The application uses SerpAPI to fetch relevant images from Google Images, enhancing the final script's visual appeal.
- User-friendly interface: The application is designed to be easy to use, with a simple input prompt and a clear display of generated results.

## Future Development

As the project progresses, we plan to add more features and refine the existing ones to provide users with an even better experience. Some potential improvements include:

- Refining the language model to generate more engaging and accurate scripts.
- Expanding the research capabilities to include more sources (e.g., Wikipedia or news articles).
- Incorporating user feedback to improve the generated scripts and overall user experience.
- Developing an option to export the final script and images to various formats, such as a text file or a slideshow presentation.

We are excited about the potential of this project and look forward to sharing updates as it continues to evolve.
